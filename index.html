        <div class="card1">One of my favorite vacations spots to go to is Virginia Beach! My husband and I went for 
            the first time and we had an amazing time. What was amazing about the place is that there is only 3 miles 
            of biking right alongside the beach so you can get your exercise and enjoy the cool breeze. Alongside the bike 
            path is various events such as performers. There is a lot of restaurants right beside the beach too that you can just 
            walk into and be served immediately. I was surprised by how many individuals were outside biking, riding rentals, or watching 
            events that unfold here.

        <div class="card1">At Virginia beach, there are many seafood restaurants to choose from but if there is a place that wins an award, 
            that place is Watermans! They have many specials at night when you arrive and they will let you know what is on the menu too. 
            I was fascinated at how packed this place was as it has a reputation for being one of the most popular restaurants in the area. Luckily
            the hotel I booked was right beside there so we were able to easily walk out of our hotel to this restaurant. I will say that service here 
            is amazing as they have over 8,000 reviews on Google.  <br>
